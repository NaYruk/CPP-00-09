# 📘 42 C++ Modules

This repository provides a **summary of the C++ modules offered by 42**, designed to progressively teach modern C++ and object-oriented programming concepts.

---

## 🎯 Module Goals

1. **Master the basics of modern C++**  
   - Classes, objects, constructors/destructors  
   - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
   - Memory management (`pointers`, `new/delete`, smart pointers)

2. **Handle advanced concepts**  
   - Templates  
   - Exceptions  
   - Operator overloading  

3. **Apply OOP principles**  
   - Clean, modular design  
   - Separation of interface and implementation  

4. **Work on practical projects**  
   - Simulate systems or simple games  
   - Create abstract classes and manage complex inheritance

## 🏗️ 42 C++ Modules (CPP00 → CPP09)

| Module | Main Focus |
|--------|------------|
| CPP00  | C refresher and basic C++ concepts |
| CPP01  | Classes, objects, constructors/destructors |
| CPP02  | Operator overloading |
| CPP03  | Templates and generic classes |
| CPP04  | Exceptions and error handling |
| CPP05  | Project combining previous concepts (small OOP project) |
| CPP06  | Inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism |
| CPP07  | Advanced templates, iterators, STL usage |
| CPP08  | Advanced OOP design, multiple inheritance, interfaces |
| CPP09  | Final project: integration of all concepts in a complex program |

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

- Advanced object-oriented programming  
- Dynamic memory management  
- Design rigor and modularity  

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each module is designed to be standalone while preparing for the next.  
- Focus is on **practice and understanding concepts**, not just syntax.
